## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
1. Team members should provide regular updates on their progress. This can be done through designated channels and threads on slack
2. Be transparent about challenges, roadblocks, and concerns. Open communication fosters trust within the team.
3. Respond to messages and emails within a reasonable time frame, typically within 12 hours.
4. Treat team members with respect and professionalism in all communications, both verbal and written.
5. Practice active listening during meetings and discussions to ensure everyone's voice is heard and understood.
6. If something is unclear, ask for clarification promptly to avoid misunderstandings.

## Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)
1. Establish meeting times weekly by collecting responses from when2meet.
2. Arrive on time for meetings and notify the team in advance if you're unable to attend.
3. Respect everyone's time by keeping meetings concise and on track.

## General Responsibilities for All Team Members
1. Strive for high-quality work and adhere to coding standards and best practices.
2. Fulfill assigned tasks within agreed-upon deadlines and contribute actively to the team's success.
3. Collaborate with team members, share knowledge, and offer assistance when needed.
4. Document your work, including code comments, README files, and any relevant project documentation.
5. Provide constructive feedback to peers to help improve the overall quality of work.

## Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines 
1. Leaders:
- Communicate effectively and in a timely manner on slack about the needs and the expectations of the team
- Submit assignments on time
- At least one leader must attend the weekly TA standup meeting
- Plan ahead and plan efficiently 
- Assign roles that fit each member’s preferences and skillset
2. Developers:
- Complete assigned tasks on-time
- work with other developers by dividing tasks and attending pair-coding sessions as needed
- Raise up any concerns / important decisions to the rest of the team
  
## Conflict Resolution
1. All members are expected to be respectful to teammates
2. If there is an escalation of conflict, bring it up to the leaders so they can come up with resolution 
3. Resolve conflicts privately rather than in the team meetings


### Failure to comply: 
- Strike 1: One of the leaders will send a message to ask for explanation 
- Strike 2: Meeting with the TA 
- Strike 3: Let’s hope we won’t have to get here but bring up to Powell

## Technical Conventions

2. Team leads will submit assignments and add all members on gradescope unless agreed otherwise in advance or both are unresponsive (hopefully will never occur)
   
### Github
1. All bigger changes should be developped in a separate branch with a well-defined name.
2. PRs should be reviewed by one other developer before merging
3. Please do not skim through PRs and give approval if there are any concerns

### Slack
1. Please try to keep all convos in public channels to maintain transparency (unless there are any conflicts)
