    - My name is Kenneth, and I'm a third year CE Revelle student. My go-to things that I enjoy doing are hanging out with others, gaming it out, and making silly arduino projects. One thing that I want to explore later on is 3D printing and CAD! 3D printing is something that I’ve always wanted to do and it looks fun. Eventually, I’ll be able to 3D print stuff that would be practical for my other hobbies!
